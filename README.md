I'm Rensora 22 Y/o I live in Belgium and i've always had a passion for how code works. and all the things you can do with it.
although i never got to deep into it, lately im trying more and more and one day ill 100% be able to fully write everything by myself!
until that day, praise the internet i'd say.
